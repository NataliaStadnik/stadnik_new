    "faq": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "question_1": "What surgeries do I perform?",
    "answer_1": "I perform tooth extractions of any complexity, implant placement, soft and hard tissue plastic surgery, and other surgical procedures aimed at restoring the health and aesthetics of a smile.",
    "question_2": "How long does a dental implant take?",
    "answer_2": "Implant placement takes approximately 40-60 minutes. The recovery period varies depending on individual circumstances and typically lasts several months.",
    "question_3": "What should I do if I experience swelling or pain after surgery?",
    "answer_3": "Mild swelling and moderate pain are normal reactions. I recommend applying cold, taking prescribed medications, and following a regimen. If symptoms worsen, consult a doctor.",
    "question_4": "Is wisdom tooth removal painful?",
    "answer_4": "Modern anesthesia methods make the procedure completely painless. You'll feel only slight pressure during the procedure, and afterward, you may experience some discomfort, which can be relieved with painkillers.",
    "question_5": "Can teeth be removed during pregnancy?",
    "answer_5": "Tooth extractions during pregnancy are performed only for strict indications and only in the second trimester to reduce risks for mother and baby.

    "question_6": "Can I return to work immediately after surgery?",
    "answer_6": "For minor extractions or uncomplicated surgeries, yes, the next day. In other cases, it's best to take 1-2 days off to allow the body to recover and reduce the risk of complications.",
    "question_7": "How long does recovery take after surgery?",
    "answer_7": "Primary healing typically takes 5-7 days. Full tissue recovery takes about 2-3 weeks. I provide detailed recommendations to ensure the process is as comfortable as possible."
